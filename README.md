# Dark-Mode

## Dark Mode is a systemwide appearance settng that uses a dark color palette to provide a comfortable viewing experience for low-light enviroments. 

In Dark Mode, the system uses a dark color palette for all screens, views, menus, and controls, and may also use greater perceptual contrast to make foreground content stand out against the darker backgrounds.

## Best Practises 

Avoid offering an app-specific appearance setting. 
An app-specific appearance mode option creates more work for people because they have to adjust more than one setting to get the appearance they want. 
Worse, they may think your app is broken because it doesn't respond to their systemwide appearance choice.
